### cognitive load

Cognitive load is a term to describe the usage of mental working memory.  [Information Processing Theory](http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/information-processing/) states, among other things, that short-term memory can only hold 5-9 "chunks" of information at a time.  This theory has become a cornerstone of cognitive psychology, so we can probably trust it.

But what does this mean for me?  Well, it means that you better use those few chunks of memory wisely!  Maybe you're using your short-term memory to solve physics problems, or to remember the orders of a section of diners, or to compete at a sport.  Whatever it is, you probably want access to as many of those chunks as possible.

This is where the bad news comes.  If you're anything like me, you're probably wasting a lot of those chunks a lot of the time.  We humans have a terrible habit of using a lot of mental capacity simply remembering simple things like what we need to buy from the grocery store tomorrow.

### mind sweep

David Allen is the creator of a system called Getting Things Done, which contains a simple task called a _mind sweep_.  The idea behind the mind sweep is to spend some time (usually about 15 minutes for me) collecting as many thoughts as possible.  By collecting things that come to mind and giving them a little attention, we can hope to become less distracted by these thoughts moving forward.


The giving of attention here is key; most of these things are floating around our heads because we promised we'd do _something_ about them later on.  That later on hasn't happened yet, so our brain will do its best to keep these ideas around until we actually do something about them.

<br />


#### lets get started

[A simple YouTube search](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guided+mind+sweep) will give plenty of results for a guided mind sweep.  A host mentions topics that are meant to trigger thoughts for collecting.  Before jumping right in, make sure you've got some time, a relatively quiet environment, and something to write on.  Once you're ready to go, start a video and just write down everything that comes to mind.  "buy dog food", "review <TEAMMATE>'s pull reqeust", "when is <FRIEND>'s birthday?" have all been on lists of mine in the past.

Once we've collected everything, the next step is to give each item a little attention.  For each item, we'll take two steps: (1) define/detail and (2) categorize.  I should note, it's also okay to look at an item and just throw it out; maybe something came to mind and now that it's been written donwn it needs no more attention.

In the defining/detailing step, look at what you've written down and make it very detailed and, if possible, actionable.  An example item might be "prepare for meeting with X".  This is much too vague.  What must you actually **do** to prepare for that meeting (maybe write an agenda, ask for input from team, etc)?  Write that down.

In the categorizing step, we'll ask a few questions of the newly defined item.

First, _is this item actionable?_  If yes, _can i do it now?_  Go do it!  If you're not going to do it **right now**, then put it on a list titled **todo** (or whatever you prefer, todo works for me).

If it was not actionable, is this something you're waiting on someone else for?  Add it to a **waiting** list.  Is this something you might do someday, but definitely not soon?  Add
it to a **wishlist** or **someday** list.  Is this just information you're trying to remember?  Add it to a **reference** list.

#### so... now i've got lists

It may be the case that simply writing these things down was cathartic enough for this to be a success the first time.  This won't help to keep mental space for very long, though.  So we need to actually use these lists.  I find my **todo** list to be very useful to look at in the morning.  I try to find a few work items and a few home items I can commit to that day and moving them somehwere I can check throughout the day.

#### we made it!

That's all there is to it.  Hopefully you're feeling a lot of mental capacity and energy right now.  For ease of reference, the lists mentioned above are:
- **todo** (you'll do in the next few days or weeks)
- **waiting** (you're waiting on action from someone else, no action needed from you)
- **someday** (you'll do this someday... maybe...)
- **reference** (just info to remember)

### what's next?

Well, so far there are a few things that have helped me:

#### constant collecting

In the first step of the mind sweep, we collected _a ton_ of thoughts, because we hadn't given them any energy in too long.  The list doesn't have to be that large, though.  Try building a habit of collecting thoughts _immediately_ when they occur.  At your desk and think, "my cat probably needs to go to the vet soon"?  Write it down now!  This requires an always available note-taking tool.  For me, [ToDo by Microsoft](http://to-do.microsoft.com/) has been perfect.


#### scheduled mind sweeps

Pretty self-explanatory, but sometimes you don't notice how much is floating around until its problematic.
