### cognitive load

cognitive load is a term to describe the usage of mental working memory.  [information processing theory](http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/information-processing/) states, among other things, that short-term memory can only hold 5-9 "chunks" of information at a time.  this theory has become a cornerstone of cognitive psychology, so we can probably trust it.

but what does this mean for me?  well, it means that you better use those few chunks of memory available to you wisely!  maybe you're using your short term memory to solve physics problems, or to remember the orders of a section of diners, or to compete at a sport.  whatever it is, you probably want access to as many of those chunks as possible.


this is where the bad news comes.  if you're anything like me, you're probably wasting a lot of those chunks far too often.  we have a terrible habit of wasting lots of short-term memory remembering things we need to do, bits of information we'll need later, or things we're waiting for others to do for us.

### mind sweep

david allen is the creator of a system called getting things done, which contains a simple task called a mind sweep.  the idea behind the mind sweep is to spend some time (usually about 15 minutes for me) collecting everything that might come to mind.  by collecting all of the things that come to mind and giving them a little attention, we can hope to become less distracted by these thoughts moving forward.


the attention here is key, most of these things are floating around our heads because we promised we'd do _something_ about them later on.  that later on hasn't happened yet, so our brain will do its best to keep them around until we actually do something about them.

<br />


#### lets get started

[a simple youtube search](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guided+mind+sweep) will give plenty of results for a guided mind sweep.  in this, a host mentions topics that are meant to trigger thoughts for collecting.  before jumping right in, make sure you've got some time, a relatively quiet environment, and something to write on.  once you're ready to go, just start writing down anything that comes to mind.  "buy dog food", "review <TEAMMATE>'s pull reqeust", "when is <FRIEND>'s birthday?" have all been on lists of mine in the past.

once we've collected everything, the next step is to give each item a little attention.  for each item, we'll take two steps: (1) define/detail and (2) categorize.  it's also okay to look at the item and just throw it out.  maybe the thought came to mind and now that it's been written it needs no more attention.

in the defining/detailing step, look at what you've written down and make it very detailed and, if possible, actionable.  an example item might be "prepare for meeting with X".  this is much too vague.  what must you actually **do** to prepare for that meeting?  write that down.

in the categorizing step, ask a few questions of the newly defined item.  first, _is this item actionable?_  if yes, _can i do it now?_  if you can do it now, go do it!  if you're not going to do it **right now**, then put it on a list titled **todo** (or whatever you prefer, todo works for me).  if it was not actionable, is this something you're waiting on someone else for?  add it to a **waiting** list.  is this something you might do someday, but definitely not soon?  add
it to a **wishlist** or **someday** list.  is this just information you're trying to remember?  add it to a **reference** list.

**we made it!**

that's all there is to it.  hopefully you're feeling a lot of mental capacity and energy right now.  for ease of reference, the lists mentioned above are:
- **todo** (you'll do in the next few days or weeks)
- **waiting** (you're waiting on action from someone else, no action needed from you)
- **someday** (you'll do this someday... maybe...)
- **reference** (just info to remember)

### what's next?

well, so far there are a few things that have helped me:

#### constant collecting

in the first step of the mind sweep, we collected _a ton_ of thoughts, because we hadn't given any energy to them in too long.  the list doesn't have to be that large, though.  try building a habit of collecting thoughts _immediately_ when they occur.  at your desk and think, "my cat probably needs to go to the vet soon"?  write it down now!  this requires an always available note-taking tool.  for me, [to-do by microsoft](http://to-do.microsoft.com/) has been perfect.


#### scheduled mind sweeps

pretty self-explanatory, but sometimes you don't notice how much is floating around until its problematic.
